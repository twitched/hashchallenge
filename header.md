# Hash Cracking

Copy this table into an Excel spreadsheet and fill in the colliding input you believe resulted in the output, and the method you used to find the collision.  The table includes the hash, the algorithm used to create the hash, and the character space of the input used to create the hash.  The points indicate how much each hash is worth. Use the Excel Sum function to total the number of points you have. When you are done, submit the Excel spreadsheet.
